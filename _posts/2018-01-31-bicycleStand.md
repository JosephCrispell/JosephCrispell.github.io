I've decided that some of my posts should document useful things I've built, hopefully making building them in the future a little easier. I am starting with our bicycle stand. ðŸš´

Our bikes have long been resting against the wall in our house in Dublin. A couple of weeks ago, I finally got round to building a stand-a-lone bicycle stand. It is made from wood found in local skips. Here are my plans:

And here it is in action! It flexes a little with the load but seems pretty sturdy.
