I had a great opportunity to talk about data ethics in practice at the [ScotSoft2020](https://www.scotlandis.com/blog/events/scotsoft-2020/) conference. I decided this would be the perfect chance to try out the amazing [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) html presentation framework. 

I've tried plenty of different ways to create presentations (like [powerpoint](https://office.live.com/start/powerpoint.aspx), [Rmarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html), [google slides](https://www.google.co.uk/slides/about/) and [LaTeX](https://www.latextemplates.com/cat/presentations)) and I'm always keen to try out new (ideally [open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)) tools.

The [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) framework represents a wacky new way to create presentations - by writing them directly in [`html`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) and it is completely free and open-source!!ðŸŽ‰

Here are the slides I put together:

I've also put a recording of my presentation on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/vcZUtzn3z70):
<iframe width="100%" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vcZUtzn3z70" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I'm not great at writing `html`, so it took me a while to get used to the reveal.js framework. Once I did though, I found it amazing and I learnt a lot! ðŸ’¡

If you're keen to try itself then head over the [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) page. Also, here's the [code](https://github.com/JosephCrispell/reveal.js/tree/master/data-ethics-in-practice) for my data ethics presentation on GitHub.
