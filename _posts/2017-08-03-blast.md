[BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) is a powerful tool that can be used to compare genetic sequences. [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) works by comparing a genetic sequence of nucleotides (`A`, `C`, `G`, and `T`) to a database of sequences.

In the UNIX environment [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) can easily be installed using the following code:

```R
# Install BLAST
sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+
```

Once installed [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) can be executed from the UNIX terminal. You can either compare your sequences to all the nucleotide data available in the online databases, using the following code:

```R
# Compare query sequences to online databases
blastn -query querySequences.fasta -out blastOutput.txt -db nr -remote
```

Or you can create a local database on your computer containing the sequences that you are interested in comparing your query sequences against, using the following code:

```R
# Make local database
makeblastdb -in databaseSequences.fasta -parse_seqids -dbtype nucl
```

With your local database created, you can compare your query sequences against it using the following code:

```R
# Compare sequences to local database
blastn -query querySequences.fasta -out blastOutput.txt -db databaseSequences -outfmt 0
```
