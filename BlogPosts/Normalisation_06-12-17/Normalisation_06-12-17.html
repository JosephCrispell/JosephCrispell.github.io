            <p>
                The term normalisation is used to refer to a number of different things: changing a distribution to make it resemble a normal
				distribution, removing redundancy from linked databases (learnt that today!), changing the scale of a distribution, or ...<br><br>
				
				I'll be referring to rescaling a distribution in this post.<br><br>
				
				Rescaling values is useful. For example, I want to scale the size of the arrows in the figure below according to how often a
				pathogen is being transmitted between populations <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>. I know the number of times each transmission
				has occurred, how can I size the arrows in the diagram below according to these counts?<br><br>				
            </p>

            <p>
                The size of the arrows is controlled by a value between 0 and 1, but my counts go from 0 to 3. In this situation I divide each
				count by the maximum of the counts (3) and then all the values will range between 0 and 1.

                I was working on the above problem today, and it got me thinking about normalisation. Am I doing it right? What information is
				lost? When can I use normalisation?<br><br>
				
				In my work, I use the following ways to normalise my data:

			<p>
                To me, the least amount of information is lost when you simply divide by the max - the scale of the data isn't lost. The normalise method
				actually the resets the minimum and maximum values, retaining the relationships between values but destroying the scale. This is 
				demonstrated in the following plots:

			<p>
				
				Pay attention to the scales! You really need to think about how the normalisation approach you selected may impact your results!<br><br>
				
				A quick note - to normalise a vector of numbers and have them sum to 1 then divide by the sum(v)<br><br>
				
				All the above was probably pretty obvious, but I guess it can't hurt to think these things through...<br><br>
