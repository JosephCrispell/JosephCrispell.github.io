            <h1>Thinking about normalisation&emsp;06-12-17</h1>
            
            <p>
                The term normalisation is used to refer to a number of different things: changing a distribution to make it resemble a normal
				distribution, removing redundancy from linked databases (learnt that today!), changing the scale of a distribution, or ...<br><br>
				
				I'll be referring to rescaling a distribution in this post.<br><br>
				
				Rescaling values is useful. For example, I want to scale the size of the arrows in the figure below according to how often a
				pathogen is being transmitted between populations <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>. I know the number of times each transmission
				has occurred, how can I size the arrows in the diagram below according to these counts?<br><br>				
            </p>

            <p>
                The size of the arrows is controlled by a value between 0 and 1, but my counts go from 0 to 3. In this situation I divide each
				count by the maximum of the counts (3) and then all the values will range between 0 and 1.

                I was working on the above problem today, and it got me thinking about normalisation. Am I doing it right? What information is
				lost? When can I use normalisation?<br><br>
				
				In my work, I use the following ways to normalise my data:
			</p>

			<p>
                I messed around with these in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and created the following plots:
			</p>
			
			<img src="NormalisationThoughts_06-12-17.png" width="100%" hspace="0.5%" vspace="1%">
			
			<p>
				
				The idea behind these plots is to highlight that understanding how you normalised your data, particularly the scale you used, is
				very important for any interpretation later on!<br><br>
				
				To finish up: Once a vector of numbers (<i>v = [a, b, c]</i>) is normalised, only the relative differences between the values 
				remain. What you lose is the context. You can't quantify how different <i>a</i> is from <i>b</i>, only how that difference 
				compares to the differences between <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>, and <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>.<br><br>
				
				Also, normalising a vector of only two numbers is pointless and all the information is lost!<br><br>
				
				All the above was probably pretty obvious, but I guess it can't hurt to think these things through...<br><br>
