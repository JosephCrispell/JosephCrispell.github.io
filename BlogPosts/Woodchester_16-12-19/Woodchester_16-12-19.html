            <h1>Tracking <i>M.  bovis</i> transmission between within and between cattle and badgers&emsp;16-12-18</h1>

            <p>
              Today, after a huge amount of work over many years, our research using genomics to look at how often <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> was transmitted within and between cattle and badgers in Woodchester Park has been published!<br><br>

              Take a look at the article <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.45833">here</a>! There is also a piece in the Guardian describing it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/17/tb-infection-from-cow-to-cow-more-likely-than-transmission-by-badger?utm_term=Autofeed&CMP=twt_gu&utm_medium=&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1576571830">here</a>. Also, listen to BBC's Today program talking about our work <a href="https://t.co/ZqppfGlIk6?amp=1">here</a> (jump to: 2:37:54).<br><br>

              <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> causes bovine tuberculosis in cattle and it costs the UK goverment tens of millions of pounds every year to control. It can infect many different species. In fact, in the UK, badger populations are can be infected and research has shown that infection can spread between cattle and badgers.<br><br>

              Woodchester Park, shown below, is a reserve in the south west of England. In this park there is a mixture of fertile farmland pasture, woodland and small ponds - the perfect place for a badger to live!
            </p>

            <p>
              Around three hundred badgers live in Woodchester Park in small social groups of 5-12 individuals. There are also cattle that graze on the fields in and around the park.<br><br>

              The south west of England has the highest levels of bovine tuberculosis in cattle in the country. Many people think that part of the reason for this is that badgers are found in large numbers here.<br><br>

              Our research used samples of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> bacteria sourced from infected cattle and badgers living in and around Woodchester Park for about 10 years. We used whole genome sequencing to generate the genomes of these bacteria. By comparing the genomes of the bacteria infecting badgers to those infecting cattle we were able to investigate whether badgers were transmitting infection to cattle or not.<br><br>

              We found that the badgers and cattle were infected with very similar strains of the <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> bacteria, sometimes even the exact same strain! This meant that infection was being transmitted between the badgers and cattle, and it must have been happening quite frequently.<br><br>

              But who was giving it to whom?<br><br>

              To estimate how often infection was transmitted from cattle to badgers, and in the other direction, we used a tool called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4534465/pdf/pgen.1005421.pdf">BASTA</a>.

            <p>
              As the diagram above shows, we found that most of our analyses estimated that badgers were transmitting infection to cattle more frequently.<br><br>

              When we looked at the transmission patterns further, we also found that <b>transmission within species occurred more frequently and transmission between species</b> (badgers were more likely to infect other badgers, and cattle other cattle, than badgers infecting cattle or <i>vice versa</i>).
            </p>

            <img src="Collaborations.png" width="75%" hspace="0.5%" vspace="1%">

            <p>
              Our research relied upon a very large collaboration between institutions across the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. The main institutions involved were the University of Glasgow, University of Edinburgh, University College Dublin, Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, Big Data Institute in Oxford, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, National Wildlife Management Centre and the Animal & Plant Health Agency.<br><br>

              <b>It is extremely important to note that our study only looked at data from Woodchester Park, a small area in the South West of England. Without further research, we don't know if what we found here is true elsewhere. We are currently investigating transmission patterns in other areas.</b><br><br>

              So that is just a brief peak at our analyses, take a look at the <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.45833">paper</a> and read about all the other interesting analyses we did!
