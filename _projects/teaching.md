Teaching data science is one of my passions. Here is where I am going to keep a note of the teaching materials that I've developed.

So far, here's the online materials that I've created:

- [Pathogen Genomics Workshop](https://github.com/JosephCrispell/pathogenGenomicsWorkshop) - a workshop designed around an R package. I'm trying to introduce the topic of building phylogenetic trees in R.
- An [introduction](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/gov-uk-rap-materials/blob/master/gov-uk-rap-materials_intro-to-rap.pdf) to creating a **R**eproducible **A**nalytical **P**ipeline (**RAP**). Well worth a look and built using the Rmarkdown [ioslides](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html) presentation tool.
- A quick [tutorial](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/gov-uk-rap-materials/blob/master/gov-uk-rap-materials_intro-to-RMySQL.Rmd) about using the [`RMySQL`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMySQL/index.html) R package. [`RMySQL`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMySQL/index.html) is a cool package that allows you to interact with a local SQL server from within R.

Hopefully I'll continue adding to these materials. Let me know what you think!
