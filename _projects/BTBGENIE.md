This time last year, [Stephen Gordon](https://people.ucd.ie/stephen.gordon) and I were furiously writing a grant for funding from the *Department of Agriculture, Food & the Marine* ([DAFM](https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/)) for their [National Research Call](https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/research/competitivenationalprogrammes/closedcalls/nationalcall2019/).

We hoped to get funding to work towards integrating whole genome sequencing into bovine tuberculosis surveillance in the Republic of Ireland.

I came up with the acronym **BTBGENIE**: **B**ovine **T**u**B**cuolosis **GEN**omics **I**r**E**land. ðŸ˜Š

In December, Steve and I found out our grant was successful and in March this year the project has begun. There were lots of interesting projects funding across all sorts of fields (read about them [here](https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/research/whatsnew/Call2019FundedProjects111219.pdf)).

I've now moved on from working at UCD but hopefully I'll still be involved.

We'll sequence the whole genome of *Mycobacterium bovis*, a bacteria that causes bovine tuberculosis, from infected cattle and wildlife. Then, by comparing these genomes we'll use there similarity to track transmission. More similar genomes, means there may have been a recent transmission event linking the animals.

By rolling out genome sequencing for bovine tuberculosis surveillance across Ireland, we'll hopefully be able to track the sources of infection in a herd more efficiently. Answering questions like:

- Could the infection have come from wildlife living locally?
- Has the herd been infected with this strain before?
- Have any other herds in Ireland been infected with the same strain?


**BTBGENIE** will be a team effort, with researchers from all over Ireland: 

- DAFM Central Veterinary Research Laboratory
- Queenâ€™s University Belfast
- The Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute in Northern Ireland
- University College Dublin

Keep a look out for our latest research! ðŸ”­
