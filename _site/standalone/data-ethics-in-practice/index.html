							First, a bit of background about my career.<br><br>

							I grew up in the highlands of Scotland and came down to Glasgow to study Zoology<br><br>

							I then went on to study pathogen transmission during my PhD<br><br>

							As my studies continued, I started to learn about programming and data and went on to use genomic data to track transmission.<br><br>

							I continued this research and then recently I joined part of the Office for National Statistics data science campus that's using data science to help AID operations around the world.

						Olivia has a done a great job of defining and exploring data ethics.<br><br>

						What I wanted to do here was reflect on what I consider to be data ethics.<br><br>

						For me, it's about exploring and understanding the good and bad of working with data.<br><br>
						
						What should we be considering as we store, process and report our data and analyses?<br><br>

						Today I'm hopefully going to illustrate some important data ethics concepts and how they arose in different projects I've worked on.

						<h2>Improving Cancer mutation detection</h2>
						<p style="position: fixed; bottom: 0; width:100%; text-align: right; font-style: italic !important">ACCURACY</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							One of the first projects I worked on was looking at methods to improve the way we identify mutations associated with different cancers<br><br>

							Cancers can be caused by a range of factors, sometimes mutations in our genomes can causes cancers. If we can identify these mutation,s we can use them to understand whether an individual might develop a cancer and what treatments might work best.<br><br>

							The team wanted to understand the accuracy of the data used to identify mutations.<br><br>
							
							Accuracy is a key data ethics consideration, here we needed to be confident that the mutations we identified were actually associated with cancers. Otherwise we might be causing unnecessary treatments or stress to future patients.

						<aside class="notes">
							The aim was to identify a panel of mutations in people's genomes that were linked to cancers.<br><br>

							When we think about accuracy here, we are thinking about those people undergoing tests and treatments because they have a particular mutation we've identified.

						<aside class="notes">
							If we tell someone they are at risk of particular cancer when they are not - a false positive - that could have devastating consequences.<br><br>

							If we don't identify an individual at risk - a false negative - then we may have missed an opportunity to catch a cancer early.<br><br>

							The ethical consequences of accurately identifying mutations associated with cancers are massive!

						<aside class="notes">
							To identify mutations, we use sequencing data. We take samples from people with and without cancers and sequence their genomes.<br><br>

							A key consideration here is that sequencing machines can make mistakes. Thankfully they do provide indicators of quality.<br><br>

							Here we have some processed sequencing data reporting the position and type of a range of mutations. Alongside this there are measures of quality that we used to understand when and why sequencing occurred to help us remove the false positive mutations that were actually sequencing errors rather than mutations associated with cancers.

						<aside class="notes">
							A later project I worked on was investigating bovine tuberculosis. A disease of cattle that affects their lungs.<br><br>

							Bovine tuberculosis is a big problem around the world and what's interesting is that it doesn't just affect cows. It can affect us and many other animals.<br><br>

							Our project aimed to understand what role wildlife playing in bovine tuberculosis in cattle in New Zealand<br><br>

							The key ethics consideration here was sampling - it was crucial we understood the limitations of the data available.

						<img src="images/newzealand_sampling.png" alt="cattle" style="width: 70%">

						<aside class="notes">
							A team in New Zealand had sampled hundreds of infected cattle and wildlife across the country.<br><br>

							Unfortunately, to address the question of transmission we needed samples from cattle and wildlife living in the same area at the same time.<br><br>

							We found that when estimated the direction of transmission between cattle and wildlife it was highly influenced by our sampling design. So in the end we had to discard that aim and simply describe the data available.<br><br>

							Being present at the time of sampling is often impossible, but what's important is recognising what questions we can ask with the data available.

						<aside class="notes">

							Learning from our work in New Zealand, we conducted similar research in England.<br><br>

							In England, there is a much bigger bovine tuberculosis problem with thousands of cattle being culled every year. Instead of possums being implicated, badgers are thought to spread infection to cattle<br><br>

							Our research aimed to address a critical unanswered question, how frequently was infection transmitted between cattle and badgers.<br><br>

							What was essential in this work was understanding the representativeness of our analyses. Where were the results of our work relevant? In our case this had important implications as our work could be used as the basis for cattle and badger population culling operations across the country.

							We need to be sure we had high quality data underpinning our analyses.
							
							So, learning from New Zealand, we gather hundreds of samples from infected cattle and badgers living in a tiny area in the South West of England - Woodchester Park.<br><br>

							With these data we were able calculate how frequently the infection was spreading from badgers to cattle and vice versa.<br><br>

							Importantly though, we sampled a tiny area in the South West of England. Our results, while important, couldn't tell us much about what was going on in the rest of the country.<br><br>

							It was essential to highlight that our project was the start of understanding the direction of transmission between badgers and cattle and more studies were needed to inform the national control strategy.

							However, there are two important aspects we are considering while we are planning this project:<br><br>

							1. How can we protect those vulnerable groups we aim to identify? From stigma, for example. Here we need to carefully consider the needs of our stakeholders and ensure access to our results is carefully restricted.<br>

							2. With highly sensitive data like HIV test results and socio-economic status, how can we protect our data subjects identities? As we work with sensitive data we need to consider these sensitivities in how we store, analyse and report our data.
