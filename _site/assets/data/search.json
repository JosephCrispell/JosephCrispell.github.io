  "content"  : "So I‚Äôve just started working with Google Apps Script.\n\n\n  Google Apps Script is a Javascript based programming language that seemlessly links to google docs.\n\n\nI‚Äôm creating a tool to update a googlesheet based on information entered into other googlesheets - ideally it‚Äôll save some time as before the updates were done manually every day.\n\nI‚Äôm relatively new to Javascript and I am brand new to Google Apps Script. Thankfully there‚Äôs plenty of help online. For general Javascript help check out the following:\n\n  w3schools provides a huge amount of training materials\n  StackOverflow never fails to disappoint to answer every weird and wonderful question\n\n\nAnd Google has written some comprehensive documentation here. You find that Google has created objects and methods for all the Google linked tools (docs, googlesheets, calendar, mail, etc.).\n\nSo a few notes from me.\n\nFirstly, get started you can visit here or create a new script by right clicking in your google drive, selecting More and then Google Apps Script.\n\nThen you‚Äôll be working on Googles IDE (Interactive Development Environment). It‚Äôs pretty basic, but it does the job and the code runs nice and quick for me.\n\n\n\nFirst thing to note is that you need to used a log file for print statements as a console doesn‚Äôt exist:\n    Logger.log(&quot;I am a bit slow!&quot;);\n\n\nTo view the log file, click View and then Logs. These are quite slow to appear! üòî\n\n\n\nSo I‚Äôve used it for a day and it has worked great. If you find yourself working on google documents then definitely consider automating your work with Google Apps Scripts!\n\n"

First, reference toc.js in templates where you would like to add the table of content. Then, create an HTML element wherever you want your table of contents to appear:\n\n&amp;lt;div id=&quot;toc&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n\n\nThen you put your post with titles and all like:\n\n## Title\n## Mid title 1\nThis is text on page one\n## Mid title 2\nThis is text for page two\n### Sub title 2.a\nSome more text\n\n\nThen at the end of your post, you call the .toc() function using:\n\n&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&amp;gt;\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(&#39;#toc&#39;).toc();\n});\n&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;\n\n\nHow it would look like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

  "content"  : "My first published research looked at bovine tubeculosis in cattle and widlife in New Zealand. Take a look at it here.\n\nWe used whole genome sequencing to trace the transmission of Mycobacterium bovis, a bacteria that causes bovine tuberculosis, between cattle and wildlife.\n\nIn New Zealand, the brushtail possum (see my impression below üò≥) is a pest species - originally imported for the fur industry. There are 30 million possums in New Zealand and they can be infected by the M. bovis bacteria. Their infection can spread into cattle, especially where cattle live close to the bush (dense forested areas), where possums live.\n\n\n\nOur research showed that the M. bovis bacteria was frequently being transmitted between cattle and wildlife populations in New Zealand. Given that there were less than 50 infected cattle herds in New Zealand at the time, this suggested that the possum population were acting as the main source of infection.\n\nFor me, this research was an amazing opportunity to work some incredible researchers in New Zealand - as well as meet them in person! Marian Price-Carter led this research project and continues to amazing work in the bovine tuberculosis program in New Zealand.\n\nHave a look at the research here and let me know what you think.\n"

  "content"  : "Firstly, what is a homoplasy? It is a trait (for example, a nucleotide at a position in an alignment) that is shared between tips that their immediate common ancestor doesn‚Äôt have.\n\nSee the left hand side of the figure below, there are tips with a T (thymine) nucleotide that are surrounded by tips with an A (adenine).\n\n\n\nHomoplasies are interesting because they make sequences seem more similar than they evolutionarily are - complicating phylogenetic analyses.\n\nHomoplasies can also help us to understand evolution, perhaps there is a benefit to a particular mutation or trait. By identifying homoplasies, we can hone in our search to mutations causing antibiotic resistance, for example.\n\nFrom the right handside of the figure above, we can see how you can identify homoplasies. Read more about how HomoplasyFinder uses the consistency index to identify here.\n\nSoon after I moved to Dublin, I decided to build HomoplasyFinder. An R package that we can use to identify homoplasies on a phylogeny using a nucleotide alignment.\n\nAfter a quick look (I should have spent longer! üò≥), I couldn‚Äôt find a tool so I decided to created my own.\n\nI spent a bit of time trying to figure out how to make my tool so that it could automatically identify homoplasies and came up a pretty good solution (I thought!). So, I created the HomoplasyFinder tool and then spent much longer figuring out whether it worked!\n\nTo my surprise, it did work and, happy with my creation, I proceeded to create an R package and write an article. I submitted my article and month later all my hopes were dashed!\n\nThe article was rejected‚Ä¶ üò≠\n\nAfter a wee bit (a lot) of grumping, I realised that my manuscript was rejected for a very good reason. I hadn‚Äôt read about the consistency index - a beautifully simple method for identifying homoplasies that was defined in the 1970s (read the article). Well, I had read about it but I hadn‚Äôt understood it! The consistency index is a measure of how consistent each site in a set of genetic sequences is with a given phylogeny. The consistency index can be thought of as a measure of how homoplasious a site is\n\nI took a break from HomoplasyFinder, trying to bury this embarrassing affair.\n\nThen after a month or two, I decided to re-make HomoplasyFinder using the consistency index. I also had a thorough look for tools that could identify homoplasies and I found a few.\n\nUnsurprisingly, my new and improved HomoplasyFinder turned out to be much faster than my previous version and, surprisingly, it was also faster, after some improvements, than the tools I found that did the same thing! (This still worries me a little, maybe I am cheating in some way!)\n\nSo, with renewed hope, I updated my manuscript and submitted to a different journal. Following some very helpful reviewers comments it got published!! üéâ\n\nA year on and I am still doing a bit of work on HomoplasyFinder and hopefully I will continue to.\n\nGive it a go and let me know what you think!\n"

  "content"  : "Today, after a huge amount of work over many years, our research using genomics to look at how often Mycobacterium bovis was transmitted within and between cattle and badgers in Woodchester Park has been published!\n\n\n  Mycobacterium bovis is a bacteria that infects cattle causing bovine tuberculosis. It costs the UK goverment tens of millions of pounds every year to control. It can infect many different species. In fact, in the UK, badger populations are can be infected and research has shown that infection can spread between cattle and badgers.\n\n\nTake a look at the article here! You can also read a nice summary in The Guardian.\n\nWoodchester Park, shown below, is a reserve in the south west of England. In this park there is a mixture of fertile farmland pasture, woodland and small ponds - the perfect place for a badger to live! ü¶°\n\n\n\nAround three hundred badgers live in Woodchester Park in small social groups of 5-12 individuals. There are also cattle that graze on the fields in and around the park.\n\nOur research used samples of Mycobacterium bovis bacteria from infected cattle and badgers living in and around Woodchester Park. We sequenced the genomes of these bacteria and  found that the badgers and cattle were infected with very similar strains of the bacteria, sometimes even the exact same strain! This meant that infection was being transmitted between the badgers and cattle, and it must have been happening quite frequently.\n\n\n  But who was giving it to whom?\n\n\nTo estimate how often infection was transmitted from cattle to badgers, and in the other direction, we used a tool called BASTA.\n\n\n\n\n  We found that badgers were transmitting infection to cattle more frequently. We also found that transmission between animals of the same species was more common. So cattle were more likely to infect other cattle and badgers other badgers, than cattle infect badgers or vice versa.\n\n\nOur research relied upon a very large collaboration between institutions across the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. The main institutions involved were:\n\n  University of Glasgow\n  University of Edinburgh\n  University College Dublin\n  Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute\n  Animal &amp;amp; Plant Health Agency\n\n\n\n  Our data was only from Woodchester Park, a small area in the South West of England. Without further research, we don‚Äôt know if what we found here is true elsewhere.\n\n\nTake a look at the paper! ü¶°üêÑü¶†üß¨\n\n"

  "content"  : "This time last year, Stephen Gordon and I were furiously writing a grant for funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine (DAFM) for their National Research Call.\n\nWe hoped to get funding to work towards integrating whole genome sequencing into bovine tuberculosis surveillance in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nI came up with the acronym BTBGENIE: Bovine TuBcuolosis GENomics IrEland. üòä\n\nIn December, Steve and I found out our grant was successful and in March this year the project has begun. There were lots of interesting projects funding across all sorts of fields (read about them here).\n\nI‚Äôve now moved on from working at UCD but hopefully I‚Äôll still be involved.\n\nWe‚Äôll sequence the whole genome of Mycobacterium bovis, a bacteria that causes bovine tuberculosis, from infected cattle and wildlife. Then, by comparing these genomes we‚Äôll use there similarity to track transmission. More similar genomes, means there may have been a recent transmission event linking the animals.\n\nBy rolling out genome sequencing for bovine tuberculosis surveillance across Ireland, we‚Äôll hopefully be able to track the sources of infection in a herd more efficiently. Answering questions like:\n\n\n  Could the infection have come from wildlife living locally?\n  Has the herd been infected with this strain before?\n  Have any other herds in Ireland been infected with the same strain?\n\n\nBTBGENIE will be a team effort, with researchers from all over Ireland:\n\n\n  DAFM Central Veterinary Research Laboratory\n  Queen‚Äôs University Belfast\n  The Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute in Northern Ireland\n  University College Dublin\n\n\nKeep a look out for our latest research! üî≠\n"

  "content"  : "My website is a place for me to take note of my interests, both inside and outside of work. I‚Äôll keep adding to, and improving, it!\n\nMost recently I‚Äôve re-designed my website, changing from a simple html and css structure to a more complex Jekyll themed website. Jekyll still uses html and css, but it also does some clever automated steps behind the scenes to make blogging a little easier.\n\nTo build my new Jekyll based website, I chose a couple of Jekyll themes (from here) and spent a bit of time extracting the bits of these that I liked and combining them into my own. The two templates I used were:\n\n\n  The Type on Strap theme to give me the blogging template (posts, projects, tagging and searching)\n  And the particle theme for the (interactive!!) front page, which uses the amazing particle.js library.\n\n\nJekyll works really well with github pages, so I was able to branch my existing website repository and get to work on the new one. Take a look at the code here.\n\nI owe a lot of thanks to the documentation of the Type on Strap and particle themes, helping me to understand how a Jekyll page works. Nothing better than a well commented and structured piece of open-source code!! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThe next project for this website is to clean up all the code, removing anything unnecessary for my website and then I plan on releasing it as a website template. There are so many cool templates out there, and maybe mine could be one of them! üòÄ\n\nTake a look around and let me know what you think.\n\n"
