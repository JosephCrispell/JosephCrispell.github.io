I've spent the last seven years studying pathogen transmission. I studied how *Mycobacterium bovis*, a bacteria that causes bovine tuberculosis, is transmitted between cattle and wildlife.

I am excited to be starting a new job as a Data Scientist. I'll be using loads of new data sources, like satellite imagery, phone records, or social media data to help aid operations around the world.

I have a passion for Data Science, teaching and science communication. I also love sport and being outside.

Joanna and I have just moved back to Glasgow, where we both studied for almost ten years, and we're excited to settle back into life here with our new baby (Aven)!
