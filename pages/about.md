I've spent the last seven years studying pathogen transmission. I studied how *Mycobacterium bovis*, a bacteria that causes bovine tuberculosis, is transmitted between cattle and wildlife.

I am excited to be joining the [Department for International Development]() (DIFD) as a Data Scientist. I'll be using data to help improving aid projects going on around the world.

I have a passion for Data Science, teaching and science communication. I also love sport and being outside.

My wife and I have just moved back to Glasgow, where we both studied for almost ten years, and we're excited to settle back into life here with our new baby!
