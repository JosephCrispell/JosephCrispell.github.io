I"@<p>A couple of weeks ago my good friend <a href="https://stevenmcgeecallender.com/home.php">Steven McGee Callender</a> planned a hiking trip in the Arrochar Alps. He managed to get me, <a href="https://twitter.com/amyjthompson">Amy Thompson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinPurefoy">Justin Purefoy</a> to join him. We selected Ben Vorlich as an achievable goal for an inexperienced crew. We parked up on the North West edge of Loch Lomond and set off on the route described <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/lochlomond/ben-vorlich-lomond.shtml">here</a>.</p>
