I"×<p>Recently I have been working with maps - trying to understand where all my samples are coming from. To do this I wanted to plot my sampling locations on top of a map. After fiddling with a number of different ways to get maps in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, I have happily fallen upon the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenStreetMap/index.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OpenStreetMap</code></a> package.</p>
