I"	<p>This time last year, <a href="https://people.ucd.ie/stephen.gordon">Stephen Gordon</a> and I were furiously writing a grant for funding from the <em>Department of Agriculture, Food &amp; the Marine</em> (<a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/">DAFM</a>) for their <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/research/competitivenationalprogrammes/closedcalls/nationalcall2019/">National Research Call</a>.</p>

<p>We hoped to get funding to work towards integrating whole genome sequencing into bovine tuberculosis surveillance in the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<p>I came up with the acronym <strong>BTBGENIE</strong>: <strong>B</strong>ovine <strong>T</strong>u<strong>B</strong>cuolosis <strong>GEN</strong>omics <strong>I</strong>r<strong>E</strong>land. ðŸ˜Š</p>

<p>In December, Steve and I found out our grant was successful and in March this year the project has begun. There were lots of interesting projects funding across all sorts of fields (read about them <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/research/whatsnew/Call2019FundedProjects111219.pdf">here</a>).</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve now moved on from working at UCD but hopefully Iâ€™ll still be involved.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll sequence the whole genome of <em>Mycobacterium bovis</em>, a bacteria that causes bovine tuberculosis, from infected cattle and wildlife. Then, by comparing these genomes weâ€™ll use there similarity to track transmission. More similar genomes, means there may have been a recent transmission event linking the animals.</p>

<p>By rolling out genome sequencing for bovine tuberculosis surveillance across Ireland, weâ€™ll hopefully be able to track the sources of infection in a herd more efficiently. Answering questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Could the infection have come from wildlife living locally?</li>
  <li>Has the herd been infected with this strain before?</li>
  <li>Have any other herds in Ireland been infected with the same strain?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BTBGENIE</strong> will be a team effort, with researchers from all over Ireland:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DAFM Central Veterinary Research Laboratory</li>
  <li>Queenâ€™s University Belfast</li>
  <li>The Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>University College Dublin</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep a look out for our latest research! ðŸ”­</p>
